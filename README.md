## Sum Strings as Numbers - Using BigInt

Given the string representations of two integers, return the string representation of the sum of those integers.

For example:

    sumStrings('1','2') // => '3'

A string representation of an integer will contain no characters besides the ten numerals "0" to "9".

For bigger integers, use BigInt(num) to evaluate whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1
